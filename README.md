# Climate Bullshit Bingo Generator
The "Bullshit Bingo Generator" is a satirical tool that highlights common climate delay arguments, which accept climate change but advocate minimal action or shift responsibility. It encourages critical thinking in climate discussions.

It is based on Lamb et al 2020 "Discourses of climate delay" 
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-sustainability/article/discourses-of-climate-delay/7B11B722E3E3454BB6212378E32985A7

## How to use

Example:
python bingo_generator.py /lambetal_2020.txt 5
